Install
=======

Formasaurus requires Python 3.8+.

To install it, run::

    pip install formasaurus[with_deps]

After installation it is convenient to execute the ``formasaurus init``
command. It ensures all necessary initialization is done. Without it,
Formasaurus may have to do CPU and memory-heavy model training on a first
import.
