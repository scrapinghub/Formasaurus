    """Return the form, data, and submit button to submit an HTML form.

    *html* is the source HTML response, where the form to submit will be found.

    *form_type* is one of the :ref:`supported form types <form-types>`. The
    returned form is the one of the specified type with the highest probability
    and a minimum probability of *min_proba*. If there is no match,
    :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

    *fields* is a dictionary of key-value pairs of data to submit with the
    form, where keys are :ref:`supported field types <field-types>` instead of
    actual form field names.

    The resulting tuple contains:

    #.  The matching form.

    #.  A dictionary of data to submit with the form. It is the content of
        *fields*, with keys replaced by their corresponding form field names.
        Missing fields are silently dropped. When multiple field names matching
        a given field type are found, the field name with the highest
        probability is used.

    #.  The submit button of the form, or ``None`` if no submit button was
        found. If multiple submit buttons are found, the one with the highest
        probability is returned.

    You can use the :doc:`form2request library <form2request:index>` to turn
    the result into an HTTP request:

    >>> form, data, submit_button = build_submission(html, "search", {"search query": "foo"})  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> request_data = form2request(form, data, click=submit_button)  # doctest: +SKIP
